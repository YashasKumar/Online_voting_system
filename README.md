# Online_voting_system
Overview
This project is a web application built using Python, Flask, and SQL to provide a seamless interface for interacting with a relational database. The backend is implemented in Python using Flask as a web framework, while the data is stored in a SQL database. The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive user interface.
There are going to be 2 kinds of users, namely Admin and Voter. Admin can add candidates who are standing for the elections and remove candidates as well. A Voter can only vote. All these features are going to be reflected in the database as well. The result is going to be shown using a pi graph, only after the election is over.
